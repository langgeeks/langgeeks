Some notes
==========

To compile this:

ghc --make Reversi.hs -o reversi


There is no specific module for now because I'm going to write all of this in 1 file, so I don't see the need yet.
I'm still learning this language, so don't expect this to be great Haskell. If you have any remarks, please share them. Afterall, that's what langgeeks is for. ;-)
